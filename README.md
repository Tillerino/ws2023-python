Slides for the course "Python für Anfänger" (German: Python for beginners)

## Content

## Technicals

The slides are based on a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) "basic install".
The folders `css`, `dist` and `plugin` were copied from there and _not modified_.

Highlighting of code in textareas is done with [highlighted-code](https://github.com/WebReflection/highlighted-code).
This did not work out-of-the-box with reveal.js, but I was able to modify the source to make it work.
The result is in `highlighted-code.js`. Sorry, I am not a JS programmer, I just made it work :D

Python code is executed in the browser with [pyodide](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide).

I started working on this after the course was already running, so the first couple of slide decks are missing.
